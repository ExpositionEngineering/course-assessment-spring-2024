# Overall Course Assessment

The purpose of this repository is to give you feedback on your overall grade in
Computer Science 203, Software Engineering. There are no files inside of this
repository and you do not need to add any files to this repository.

Alternatively, the course instructor will add overall course assessment reports
to either the issue tracker or the pull requests tracker in this repository.
Students who have questions about their overall assessments are encouraged to
schedule a meeting with the course instructor during office hours.

As explained in the course syllabus, the grade that a student receives in this
class will be based on the following categories. All of these percentages are
approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself, the course instructor may
change the assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Team Participation       |  5%        |
| In-Person Assessments    |  5%        |
| Midterm Examinations     |  10%       |
| Final Examination        |  10%       |
| Professional Development |  15%       |
| Technical Development    |  15%       |
| Project Development      |  40%       |

Here are some additional details about the recording and reporting of the course
assessments:

- **Team Participation**: This includes all of the team participation scores up
to the week prior to the one at which the overall assessment was submitted.
- **In-Person Assessments**: When this score is reported before the completion
of the second in-person assessment, it assumes that a student earned a perfect
score on the not-yet-completed in-person assessment. This means that this score
may be an over-estimate of the final grade that a student will earn in this
category.
- **Midterm Examinations**: When this score is reported before the completion of
the second midterm examination, it assumes that a student earned a perfect score
on the not-yet-completed midterm examination. This means that this score may be
an over-estimate of the final grade that a student will earn in this category.
- **Final Examination**: When this score is reported before the completion of
the final examination, it assumes that a student earned a perfect score on the
not-yet-completed final examination. This means that this score may be an
over-estimate of the final grade that a student will earn in this category.
- **Professional Development**: This score is a composite of an individual
student's score for professional development and the overall score that the team
has earned for professional development articles published on the course web
site. An individual student's work contributes to 70% of this score and the
overall team score contributes to the remaining 30% of this score. Both of these
scores consider only those assessments recorded up to the week prior to the one
at which the overall assessment was submitted.
- **Technical Development**: This score is a composite of an individual
student's score for technical development and the overall score that the team
has earned for technical development articles published on the course web site.
An individual student's work contributes to 70% of this score and the overall
team score contributes to the remaining 30% of this score. Both of these scores
consider only those assessments recorded up to the week prior to the one at
which the overall assessment was submitted.
- **Project Development**: All interim reports of this score represent an
individual's contribution to the long-term software engineering projects. As
explained on the course syllabus, the final reports of this score will also
factor in whether or not the entire team of students completed, in a timely
fashion, a high-quality project that meets all of the stated requirements.
- **Final Grade**: This score is a percentage out of 100%. When this score is
part of an interim report it may represent an over-estimate of a student's final
grade because of the fact that it incorporates other over-estimates in one of
its constituent scores. This score weights the constituent scores according to
the percentages that are provided in the table in this document and in the
course syllabus.
