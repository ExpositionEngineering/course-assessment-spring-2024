# Overall Course Assessment

The purpose of this repository is to give you feedback on your overall grade in
FS 102, Exposition Engineering. Beyond this file, there are no files inside of
this repository and you do not need to add any files to this repository.

The course instructor will add overall course assessment reports to either the
issue tracker or the pull requests tracker in this repository. Students who
have questions about their overall assessments are encouraged to
[schedule](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) a meeting with the
course instructor during office hours.

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may change the assigned percentages
during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Studio Participation     |  20%       |
| Show Proposals           |  25%       |
| Show Outlines            |  25%       |
| Peer Reviews             |  10%       |
| Recorded Episodes        |  10%       |
| Podcast Presentation     |  10%       |

Here are some additional details about the recording and reporting of the course
assessments:

- **Team Participation**: This includes all of the studio participation scores
that reflect your timely attendance in class, participation in class activities
such as stand-up meetings, and participation in the studio discussions on
Discord. This also includes the assessment of any supporting assignments focused
on creating, for instance, the visual and audio identity of the podcast.
Finally, this includes a certification that a learner demonstrated competency of
the use of the software, like VS Code and GitHub, that supports the operation of
the podcasting studio.
- **Show Proposals**: This includes the assessment of six show proposals that
offer information about the theme of and guest for an episode of a podcast. Each
show proposal must appear as a file in a GitHub repository that originated from
GitHub Classroom and contains a commit history demonstrating consistent work
towards the completion of the writing assignment.
- **Show Outlines**: This includes the assessment of six show outlines that
feature written content for an introduction to both the podcast and the guest, a
detailed series of questions for the question, and a conclusion to the podcast
episode. Each show outline must appear as a file in a GitHub repository that
originated from GitHub Classroom and contains a commit history demonstrating
consistent work towards the completion of the writing assignment.
- **Peer Reviews**: This includes the assessment of peer reviews that a student
submits to the pull request (PR) in the GitHub repository of their peer review
partner. Each student is responsible for adding to a separate GitHub repository
a list of the PRs that they submitted to the GitHub repository of their peer
review partner so as to facilitate the assessment of the completed peer reviews.
- **Recorded Episodes**: Along with the certification that a learner completed
the required training for use of the podcasting studio, this includes the
single-take recording, editing, and engineering of two podcast episodes, the
final versions of which must be uploaded in `WAV` and `MP3` format to a Google
Drive.
- **Podcast Presentation**: This includes an assessment of a final presentation
given on the day of the final examination, Friday, May 3, 2024 at 9:00 AM.
- **Final Grade**: This score is a percentage out of 100%. When this score is
part of an interim report it may represent an over-estimate of a student's final
grade because of the fact that it incorporates other over-estimates in one of
its constituent scores. This score weights the constituent scores according to
the percentages that are provided in the table in this document.
