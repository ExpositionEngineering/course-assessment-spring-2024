# Overall Course Assessment

The purpose of this repository is to give you feedback on your overall grade in
FS 102, Exposition Engineering. There are no files inside of this repository
and you do not need to add any files to this repository.

The course instructor will add overall course assessment reports to either the
issue tracker or the pull requests tracker in this repository. Students who
have questions about their overall assessments are encouraged to
[schedule](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) a meeting with the
course instructor during office hours.

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may change the assigned percentages
during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Studio Participation     |  20%       |
| Show Proposals           |  25%       |
| Show Outlines            |  25%       |
| Peer Review Projects     |  10%       |
| Recorded Episodes        |  10%       |
| Podcast Presentation     |  10%       |

assessments:

- **Team Participation**: This includes all of the studio participation scores
that reflect your timely attendance in class, participation in class
activities, and participation in studio discussions on Discord.
- **In-Person Assessments**: When this score is reported before the completion
of the second in-person assessment, it assumes that a student earned a perfect
score on the not-yet-completed in-person assessment. This means that this score
may be an over-estimate of the final grade that a student will earn in this
category.
- **Professional Development**: This score is a composite of an individual
- **Technical Development**: This score is a composite of an individual
- **Project Development**: All interim reports of this score represent an
- **Final Grade**: This score is a percentage out of 100%. When this score is
part of an interim report it may represent an over-estimate of a student's
final grade because of the fact that it incorporates other over-estimates in
one of its constituent scores. This score weights the constituent scores
according to the percentages that are provided in the table in this document
and in the course syllabus.
